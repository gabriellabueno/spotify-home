 
# :headphones: Spotify Landing Page Clone

This project was developed during a 5-day immersion course organized by Alura.  
It involved recreating the landing page of Spotify, providing an oportunity for learning and practice in various Front-end technologies.

## :wrench: Technologies Used

* **HTML**: Structured the web content.
* **CSS**: Styled the web page.
* **JavaScript**: Added interactivity to the webpage.
* **React**: Built the user interface with reusable components.
* **NodeJs**: Developed a mock API for local testing.

## :white_check_mark: Tasks Completed

✔ Recreated the Spotify landing page.
✔ Added responsiveness to the project using Media Queries.
✔ Developed a mock API for local testing.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Next Steps

One of the primary goals for this project is to replace the current fake API with the **official Spotify API**. This will allow the application to interact with real Spotify data, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience. 

Stay tuned for updates on this project as I continue to work towards this goal!
